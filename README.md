## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Bettercap Sniffing

# Start bettercap
```bash
sudo bettercap -iface eth0
```

# Discover hosts
```
net.probe on
net.recon on
```
# Start ARP spoofing (replace with target IP)
```
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.1.100
arp.spoof on
```
# Begin packet sniffing
```
net.sniff on
```
# Monitor events in real-time
```
events.stream
```

### Python Sniffer Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *

def packet_handler(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(IP):
        print(f"[+] {packet[IP].src} -> {packet[IP].dst} | Protocol: {packet[IP].proto}")

# Start sniffing
sniff(prn=packet_handler, count=50, filter="tcp")
```

### Wireshark Quick Analysis
```bash
# Capture HTTP traffic only
wireshark -i eth0 -f "tcp port 80" -w http_capture.pcap

# Analyze existing capture
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http" -T fields -e http.request.uri
```

## üîç What is Packet Sniffing?

Packet sniffing is the practice of capturing and analyzing data packets as they travel across a network. Think of it as **"eavesdropping on digital conversations"** to understand, diagnose, and secure network communications.

### How It Works:
- **Promiscuous Mode**: Network card captures ALL packets, not just those addressed to it
- **MITM Positioning**: Placing yourself between communication points
- **Protocol Analysis**: Decoding various network protocols
- **Traffic Inspection**: Examining packet contents and patterns

### What You Can Capture:

| Traffic Type | Visibility | Example Data | Security Impact |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **HTTP** | üîì Full Content | Passwords, cookies, images | High - Plaintext data |
| **HTTPS** | üîí Encrypted | Only metadata visible | Low - Encrypted content |
| **DNS** | üîì Queries | Websites being visited | Medium - Privacy exposure |
| **FTP** | üîì Full Content | Files, credentials | High - Plaintext credentials |
| **SMTP** | üîì Full Content | Emails, attachments | High - Sensitive data |
| **TCP** | üîì Headers | Connection patterns | Medium - Network mapping |

### Common Use Cases:
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identify connectivity issues
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect intrusions and attacks
- **Performance Analysis**: Optimize network performance
- **Forensic Investigation**: Analyze security incidents
- **Protocol Development**: Test and debug network protocols

## üõ°Ô∏è Detection & Prevention

### How to Detect Sniffing:

#### ARP Spoofing Detection:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from scapy.all import *
import time
from collections import defaultdict

arp_table = {}
alert_threshold = 3

def monitor_arp(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(ARP):
        ip = packet[ARP].psrc
        mac = packet[ARP].hwsrc
        
        if ip in arp_table and arp_table[ip] != mac:
            print(f"[ALERT] ARP Spoof detected: {ip} changed from {arp_table[ip]} to {mac}")
        
        arp_table[ip] = mac

sniff(prn=monitor_arp, filter="arp", store=0)
```

#### Network Anomaly Detection:
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Unexpected protocol usage
- Suspicious port activity
- Data exfiltration attempts

### Prevention Measures:

#### Encryption:
```bash
# Always use encrypted protocols
HTTPS instead of HTTP
SSH instead of Telnet
SFTP instead of FTP
VPN for sensitive communications
```

#### Network Segmentation:
```bash
# Separate sensitive networks
VLANs for different departments
DMZ for public services
Air-gapped critical systems
```

#### Monitoring and Auditing:
```bash
# Implement continuous monitoring
arpwatch -i eth0
suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
security onion for comprehensive monitoring
```

#### Switch Security:
```bash
# Configure switch protections
port security max-mac-count 1
dhcp snooping
dynamic arp inspection
storm control
```

### Defense in Depth Strategy:

1. **Perimeter Defense**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS
2. **Network Segmentation**: VLANs, access controls
3. **Host Protection**: EDR, host-based firewalls
4. **Encryption**: Data in transit and at rest
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous traffic analysis
6. **Incident Response**: Prepared detection and response

## üéØ 516 Hackers Methodology

### Our Approach to Packet Analysis:

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
```bash
# Network discovery and mapping
netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
bettercap -iface eth0 -eval "net.probe on; net.recon on"
```

#### Phase 2: Traffic Capture
```bash
# Strategic packet acquisition
tcpdump -i eth0 -w reconnaissance.pcap
bettercap -iface eth0 -eval "set net.sniff.output targeted.pcap; net.sniff on"
```

#### Phase 3: Analysis
```bash
# Deep packet inspection
wireshark targeted.pcap
tshark -r targeted.pcap -Y "http" -T fields -e http.request.uri
python3 scripts/traffic-analyzer.py -f targeted.pcap
```

#### Phase 4: Reporting
```bash
# Documentation and findings
capinfos targeted.pcap
tshark -r targeted.pcap -z io,phs
python3 scripts/generate-report.py -f targeted.pcap -o report.html
```

### 516 Principles:

#### Knowledge First
> "Understand the protocol before you capture it. Read the RFCs, study the specifications, know what normal looks like before hunting for anomalies."

#### Stealth with Purpose
> "Be invisible when necessary, but always for legitimate reasons. Leave no trace unless documenting authorized testing."

#### Leave No Trace
> "Clean up after your testing. Restore network configurations, clear ARP caches, and remove any temporary changes."

#### Share Wisdom
> "Document your findings, contribute to the community, and help others learn. Knowledge grows when shared."

### Ethical Decision Framework:

1. **Authorization**: Do I have explicit permission?
2. **Purpose**: Is this for legitimate security testing?
3. **Scope**: Am I staying within authorized boundaries?
4. **Impact**: Could this disrupt normal operations?
5. **Documentation**: Am I properly documenting my activities?
6. **Cleanup**: Will I restore everything to its original state?
